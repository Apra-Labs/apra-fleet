# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **OpenCode provider** -- OpenCode is now a first-class provider
  (`apra-fleet install --llm opencode`). It works with any OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint (Ollama, vLLM, etc.) for self-hosted and local models. The model
  endpoint is the user's responsibility; Fleet installs the CLI and agents but
  does not provision the inference server. See
  [docs/opencode-exploration.md](docs/opencode-exploration.md) for background.

- **Per-member model tiers** -- `register_member` now accepts an optional
  `model_tiers` map (`{ cheap, standard, premium }`) so each member can specify
  which models to use at each tier. Particularly useful for OpenCode members
  where models vary by deployment. A single-model entry fills all three tiers.
  When no map is set, the provider adapter's defaults are used.

- **PM agent installation** -- the installer now writes 4 PM agent definitions
  (planner, plan-reviewer, doer, reviewer) to each provider's agents directory
  (e.g. `~/.claude/agents/`, `~/.config/opencode/agents/`). For OpenCode,
  agent frontmatter is transformed from Claude format to OpenCode format
  (tools allowlist -> permission map, mode: subagent). Codex and Copilot skip
  agent installation (no agent system).

### Changed

- **PM skill sourced from apra-pm submodule** -- the PM skill is now vendored
  from the [apra-pm](https://github.com/Apra-Labs/apra-pm) git submodule at
  `vendor/apra-pm/` instead of being maintained inline. All gap-ported features
  from the old inline skill (sprint selection, operational rules, provider
  awareness, fleet addendum, simple sprint, resume rules, documentation harvest)
  are included. The skill is backward compatible -- all `/pm` commands, state
  file names (PLAN.md, progress.json, feedback.md, status.md), and beads
  lifecycle hooks are preserved.
