# Fleet Deploy Runbook

## Permissions

Commands below require these prefixes in `.claude/settings.json` under `permissions.allow`:
- `Bash(*apra-fleet-installer-* install *)`
- `Bash(*apra-fleet* --version)`
- `Bash(npm ci)`
- `Bash(npm run build)`
- `Bash(npm run build:binary)`
- `Bash(dist/apra-fleet-installer-* install *)`

## Deploy

Builds from source and installs locally using installer binary is found inside ./dist folder with install --force arguments

**Caution: `install --force` stops the running fleet server first.** This is
the shared singleton MCP server (`localhost:7523`) that every live supervisor
sprint's dispatches depend on, not just your own MCP connection. If a
supervisor is running sprints when you deploy, the restart can collaterally
kill their child processes. Before deploying onto a machine running the
supervisor, check `GET /api/sprints` for active sprints; if any are running,
either wait for them to finish or be ready to force-release their stale
reservations and relaunch afterward.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run build:binary

INSTALLER="dist/apra-fleet-installer-${PLATFORM}-${SEA_ARCH}"
[ "$PLATFORM" = "win" ] && INSTALLER="${INSTALLER}.exe"

"$INSTALLER" install --force
"$HOME/.apra-fleet/bin/apra-fleet" start || "$HOME/.apra-fleet/bin/apra-fleet.exe" start
```

## Smoke test

```bash
"$HOME/.apra-fleet/bin/apra-fleet" --version || "$HOME/.apra-fleet/bin/apra-fleet.exe" --version
```
Exit 0 = healthy. Call `version` (`mcp__apra-fleet__version` in Claude Code) and
confirm it matches the version/commit just built, then call `fleet_status` to
check online members. If `version` doesn't match, reconnect your MCP client
(`/mcp` in Claude Code, or restart your provider CLI) and retry.

## Rollback

No automated rollback. Check out the previous commit and re-run `## Deploy`
above.
